### Overview

If you have more than one person using your Netflix account and rating movies, you've probably got wacky recommendations. Now that Netflix has User Profiles, you can keep them separated to prevent this from happening in the future... but what about all of your current, totally messed up movie recommendations?

You may want to clear all of your ratings. This bookmarklet will help you do that.

Simply [install the bookmarklet](http://jjack.github.io/clear-netflix-ratings-bookmarklet/), visit http://movies.netflix.com/MoviesYouveSeen, and click your new bookmark. It will clear all of the ratings on the current page and move on to the next one.
