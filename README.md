### Overview

If you had more than one person using Netflix, your ratings are probably all messed up. Now that Netflix has User Profiles, you can keep them separated in the future... but what about all of your current, totally messed up recommendations?

I've found the easiest way to fix that is to just clear them all out and start over from scratch. This is a javascript bookmarklet that will help the process.

Simply [install the bookmarklet](http://jjack.github.io/clear-netflix-ratings-bookmarklet/), visit your ratings, and click it. It will clear all of the ratings on the current page and move on to the next.
